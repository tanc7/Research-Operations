# New Idea, Randomware Generator
So I had a discussion with someone in a meetup group that I won't disclose the identity of.

Basically he told me this.

"I don't want to lose anything in my hard drive. I need to back them up first. But, even though the data is valuable to me, I don't believe anyone else could make use of it."

And I asked him, "How much do you think it's worth?"

He replied, "To me, millions of dollars that covers all of my ideas".

I told him what if I encrypted everything on his hard drive and held it for ransom against him?, much to the laughter of my brother

"Well. Shit. Never thought of that."

# And That is how... OPERATION HELLS HORSES is born

I still need to do a lot of research. I can't guarantee a ETA of delivery of a PoC. But I want to see if through compromise by a reverse shell or exploit, whether or not I can remotely execute a payload that can encrypt a victim's hard drive on my own, and hold it for ransom, while maintaining control of the flow of public information to avoid LE from disrupting it.

Now where do I start?
